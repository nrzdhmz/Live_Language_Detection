# Live Zoom Subtitles ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¬

This project provides **real-time subtitles** for Zoom (or any app) by capturing both:
- **Your microphone input** (what you say)  
- **System audio via BlackHole** (what others say)  

The result is displayed in a floating GUI window, always on top, like live captions.
